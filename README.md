Music Playlist Manager App 

This is a simple android app i built with kotlin code to help users manage their music playlist. This app allows users to rate songs, add comments, and input information about the artist. The app caters to four songs. It also allows them to view a summary of their list. 

This app features Song Title, Artist Name, Rating (1-5), and Comments. 

View all songs with ratings of 3 or more. It is user friendly; I built it using android studio and Kotlin code
